Lithium contact app
===================

.. module:: lithium.contact
	:synopsis: Lithium contact application

Lithium contact is a simple contact form allowing users of your website to easily contact you via email.

Quick start guide
=================

To get started using the ``contact`` app, follow these steps:

	#. Install the blog app by adding ``'lithium.contact'`` to
	   ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
	
	#. Add the contact app's URLs to your project's ``urls.py``:
	
		.. code-block:: python
		
			urlpatterns = patterns('',
				...
				url(r'^contact/', include('lithium.contact.urls')),
				...
			)
	
	#. Add your email address to the ``MANAGERS`` section of ``settings.py``:
	
	    .. code-block:: python
		
			MANAGERS = (
				('Kyle Fuller', 'inbox@kylefuller.co.uk'),
			)

Using your own templates
========================

There are just two templates, one for the contact form, and another is displayed once the contact form is completed. This displays a confirmation to the user.

``contact/contact_form.html``
-----------------------------

This template gets passed a ``django.forms.Form`` via the context ``form``. This template should render the form, and display any validation errors if there were any.

Rendering a custom form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A complete form might look like:

.. code-block:: html+django
    
    <form action="{% url contact_form %}" method="post">
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

``contact/contact_confirmation.html``
-------------------------------------

This template shows a confirmation to the user that there message has been sent.
