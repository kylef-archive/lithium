Lithium
=======

Lithium is a set of applications written for the Django web framework. Lithium's goal is to provide every generic application a user may want on their website, such as a blog, forum, wiki, etc. Lithium could be installed to work as a content management system, my own personal website is ran by Lithium, and a few django apps such as flatpages.
