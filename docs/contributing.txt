Ideas

If you have any ideas on what could be added to Lithium, whether its a small template tag to an existing lithium app, or a new app. You can send your ideas to `kylef`_.

Code
====

If you have any patches for Lithium, you could send them to `kylef`_ and if the patches are good, he will add them. You could also fork the git repository, and send kylef a link to the git repository. Then kylef can keep track of what you are doing, and merge it back into the main repository if the changes are good.

Before making any changes or patches, please look closely at how lithium is written, such as 4 spaces instead of tabs. Follow the style of the code in your patches.
